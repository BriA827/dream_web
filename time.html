        <p>&emsp;I have taken both Intro to Python and Data Analysis classes offered at Portland High School. I plan to continue this path by taking Web Development and Game Design in Junior and Senior year, respectively. Computer science careers and colleges also value high math and science levels. I am not very interested in science, but I have and plan to continue taking the Honors courses (next year chemistry and Senior year - hopefully - physics). I am a bit behind compared to my peers, but by the end of high school I will have finished AP Calculus AB.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;As stated previously, showing that I am adept in coding, math, and science is a must. I am going to continue keeping my grades up, so that I can show to colleges that I am a person of a hardworking nature and of good intellect.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;I want to attend a four-year college to earn a degree in computer science. Depending on if I gain any scholarships, I might take a gap year to focus on working (unrelated to coding) just so I can save up some money for my college expenses. After graduating, I might have a difficult time finding a job. Hopefully I’ll have already started making my own projects and connections that I will have some start in the computer science world, but otherwise, I’ll have to really advertise myself.</p>
        <p>&emsp;My end goal is to ultimately be happy. I don’t really want to work for a company, I’d rather be my own boss, so I suppose if that ever came to fruition then I’d know I’ve achieved what I wanted. I don’t value fame, but if there’s one kid who uses something that I made and that inspires them, then that’s more than I could ask for.
