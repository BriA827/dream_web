        <p>&emsp;While doing this project, I’ve learned that the future is even more daunting than before and I wish that I hadn't started planning this all out. I’d prefer to just let stuff happen, and save myself the stress and worry, but I understand that going into life blinded is a terrible decision. Going into computer science is something I want to do, but it’s not my dream. If things don’t work out, there’s other stuff I want to do in life too (graphic design, voice acting, stage acting, costume making, etc.). I have enjoyed the process of creating this website, but I know it's definitely beginner level. I do want to continue this type of work though, as I find the payoff rewarding. It's like a, "Hey! I made that! Look how cool it is!"
