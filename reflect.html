        <p>&emsp;In attempting to work in the computer science field, there are a number of financial issues I must consider. To be taken seriously in that field, a degree is a must. However, college is not cheap. According to EducationData.org, the average U.S. tuition is $27,279 for one year, or $109,116 for four years. Those numbers only include tuition. For all materials and living expenses, the yearly price increases to $35,551. I am not the child of a billionaire, unfortunately, and do not have that much money at my disposal. Unless my absent father is secretly rich and dies soon and leaves me money (which is only a fantasy I can wish for), I will have to procure the funds myself. As of last year, I was the tenth in my class of 200-something (and this year the gym midterm bumped me down to eleventh). I hope that by continuing to keep my grades and rank up, along with taking Honors and APs, some colleges will take pity on me and grant me scholarships. I dream of a full ride, as otherwise I most likely will not be able to afford college, but I know that’s only wishful thinking. I am just extremely hesitant to take out loans, as I have seen what happens when they consume your life, but, unfortunately, I will probably have to. Loans will add a  lot of stress to my life, as I’ll then have to have a job while attending school, meaning I’ll be juggling everything and getting even less sleep than I do now. I do want to pursue higher education, but not at the risk of my financial security for the rest of my life. I have thought of enrolling in smaller colleges, but there lies the issue of how good the computer science programs will be.

        <p>&emsp;While doing this project, I’ve learned that the future seems even more daunting than before and I wish I never started planning. I’d prefer to just let stuff happen, and save myself the stress and worry. Going into computer science is something I want to do, but it’s not my dream. If things don’t work out, there’s other stuff I want to do in life too (graphic design, voice acting, stage acting, costume making, etc.).
