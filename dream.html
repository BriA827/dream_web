    <h2>My Dream</h2>
    <div class="drps">
        <p class="drp">&emsp;While I do not have a dream per se, I do have some ideas for what I want in my future. I want to pursue a career in computer science, with artistic aspects like graphic design. I love creating things. I want a job I would take pride and pleasure in, not a boring office job. Being in computer science - making video games, websites, etc. - I would be able to express myself and make things that others could enjoy as well.</p>
        <p class="drp">&emsp;Working in computer science will not be easy, as it is a challenging field with gender inequality. Computer science is a male-dominated field, and as a non-binary person assigned female at birth, I am not naive to think I will not face some barriers. However, I am a very stubborn person, and if there is something that I want, I will do everything I can to achieve that. I have studied computer science for two years now, and plan on taking the next two classes offered in high school, as well as pursuing a college degree. 
        </p>
        <p class="drp">&emsp;As said before, I want a job that allows me to express my creativity. I value my happiness above the economy and productivity of the nation, so I'd rather have fun making silly little games than sitting at a desk for nine hours. I love playing video games, I know what aspects of them I enjoy, and I want to be able to make a game that I and many other people would love. Computer science, and the digital world in general, are not going away anytime soon, so I know that I am guaranteed some type of job in that field when I am ready to work. Or, I could be my own boss and start a small company by myself. Whatever way I end up going, I know that I will be happy not being forced to fit in with the stereotypical workforce.</p>
